# ExactMP: An Efficient Parallel Exact Solver for Phylogenetic Tree Reconstruction Using Maximum Parsimony

Constructing phylogenetic trees in the study of the evolutionary
history of a group organisms is an extremely challenging problem in
computational biology. The problem becomes intractable with growing
number of organisms. This software implements an efficient parallel
solver (ExactMP) using a parsimony based approach for solving this
problem.
